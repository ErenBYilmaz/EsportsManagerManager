# game design:

## resources:
- time (days)
- money (€)
- health (measured how?)
- motivation (measured in skill points)
- hidden elo (measured in skill points)

## gameplay options:

- each action costs a day of time
- one tournament match each week, so at most 7 actions
- EU4-like events whenever you do something
- after each action two things happen:
  1. feedback for the action (e.g. -3 €, +3 skill)
  2. occasional random event
